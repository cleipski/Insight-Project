# TargAd
## Maximize the impact of your investment

TargAd is a tool that helps advertisers optimize the return of their investment by finding the best locations given the subject matter of the (targeted) advertisement. For this project I leveraged tagged public images from Flickr and using kernel density estimates and clustering techniques to identify local hot spots in customer interest.

This project was completed in about 2.5 weeks as part of the Data Science Fellowship at <href src="http://insightdatascience.com">Insight Data Science</href>. 

The interactive web application is available at <href src="http://targad.me">TargAd.me</href>.

This repository includes a detailed report on the final workflow

as well as additional exploratory code from the development process.
